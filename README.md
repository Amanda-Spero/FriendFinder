**Friend Finder**

* The purpose of this app is to collect data about the user, and then match the user with another user's profile whose answers most closely match those of the first user.

* The user will be asked to enter their name and a link to a profile picture.  They will they be shown 10 statements and asked through the use of a drop down menu whether they strongly agree, strongly disagree, or something in between the two.

* Upon hitting the submit button the user's information will be saved and the answers to the 10 statements will be compated against those of previous users.  The user whose answers most closely match those of the new user will be chosen, and through the use of a module the new user will see the name and profile picture of the matching user.
